Instead she finds herself stuck in desperate singlehood, spending her days working in the legendary British bookshop, Shakespeare & Co in Paris, rather than pursuing her own ambitions of becoming a novelist. But when an unexpected invitation to the Jane Austen Writers' Residency in England lands in her lap, Agathe is in for an eye-opening and life-changing experience. Encouraged to confront her insecurities and explore her true romantic, sexual and creative nature, in part thanks to her eccentric co-residents, Agathe realises it’s time to stop wasting her sentimental life and take control - over both her writing aspirations, and her very own love story.\n\nStarring Camille Rutherford (Anatomy of a Fall), Pablo Pauly (The French Dispatch) and Charlie Anson (Death on the Nile), Jane Austen Wrecked My Life is an uplifting and heart-warming throwback to classic romance, with a modern sensibility, marking the directorial debut of acclaimed screenwriter Laura Piani.",

And from Pete\"s descriptions, Elliott seems remarkably similar to the dragon from Mr. Meacham\"s stories.

Haneke finds his match in Isabelle Huppert, who delivers an icy but quietly seething performance as Erika, a middle-aged piano professor at a Viennese conservatory who lives with her mother, in a claustrophobically codependent relationship. Severely repressed, she satisfies her masochistic urges only voyeuristically until she meets Walter (Benoît Magimel), a young student whose desire for Erika leads to a destructive infatuation that upsets the careful equilibrium of her life. A critical breakthrough for Haneke, The Piano Teacher—which won the Grand Prix as well as dual acting awards for its stars at Cannes—is a formalist masterwork that remains a shocking sensation.",

With depleted resources, only a tent and some essentials between them, every step along the path is a testament to their growing strength and determination.

      "synopsis": "Agathe, hopelessly clumsy yet charming, and full of contradictions, dreams of experiencing love akin to a Jane Austen novel. Instead she finds herself stuck in desperate singlehood, spending her days working in the legendary British bookshop, Shakespeare & Co in Paris, rather than pursuing her own ambitions of becoming a novelist. But when an unexpected invitation to the Jane Austen Writers' Residency in England lands in her lap, Agathe is in for an eye-opening and life-changing experience. Encouraged to confront her insecurities and explore her true romantic, sexual and creative nature, in part thanks to her eccentric co-residents, Agathe realises it’s time to stop wasting her sentimental life and take control - over both her writing aspirations, and her very own love story.\n\nStarring Camille Rutherford (Anatomy of a Fall), Pablo Pauly (The French Dispatch) and Charlie Anson (Death on the Nile), Jane Austen Wrecked My Life is an uplifting and heart-warming throwback to classic romance, with a modern sensibility, marking the directorial debut of acclaimed screenwriter Laura Piani.",

      "synopsis": "A love triangle of jealousy in the Parisian art scene of the 1930s is brought to life in a stylish docufiction about iconic artist and architect Eileen Gray, who built her modernist dream house on the Riviera, only to be upstaged by Le Corbusier.\r\n\r\nEileen Gray had a truly eminent sense of design. The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke.

Haneke finds his match in Isabelle Huppert, who delivers an icy but quietly seething performance as Erika, a middle-aged piano professor at a Viennese conservatory who lives with her mother, in a claustrophobically codependent relationship. Severely repressed, she satisfies her masochistic urges only voyeuristically until she meets Walter (Benoît Magimel), a young student whose desire for Erika leads to a destructive infatuation that upsets the careful equilibrium of her life. A critical breakthrough for Haneke, The Piano Teacher—which won the Grand Prix as well as dual acting awards for its stars at Cannes—is a formalist masterwork that remains a shocking sensation.",

Instead she finds herself stuck in desperate singlehood, spending her days working in the legendary British bookshop, Shakespeare & Co in Paris, rather than pursuing her own ambitions of becoming a novelist. But when an unexpected invitation to the Jane Austen Writers' Residency in England lands in her lap, Agathe is in for an eye-opening and life-changing experience. Encouraged to confront her insecurities and explore her true romantic, sexual and creative nature, in part thanks to her eccentric co-residents, Agathe realises it’s time to stop wasting her sentimental life and take control - over both her writing aspirations, and her very own love story.\n\nStarring Camille Rutherford (Anatomy of a Fall), Pablo Pauly (The French Dispatch) and Charlie Anson (Death on the Nile), Jane Austen Wrecked My Life is an uplifting and heart-warming throwback to classic romance, with a modern sensibility, marking the directorial debut of acclaimed screenwriter Laura Piani.",

Haneke finds his match in Isabelle Huppert, who delivers an icy but quietly seething performance as Erika, a middle-aged piano professor at a Viennese conservatory who lives with her mother, in a claustrophobically codependent relationship. Severely repressed, she satisfies her masochistic urges only voyeuristically until she meets Walter (Benoît Magimel), a young student whose desire for Erika leads to a destructive infatuation that upsets the careful equilibrium of her life. A critical breakthrough for Haneke, The Piano Teacher—which won the Grand Prix as well as dual acting awards for its stars at Cannes—is a formalist masterwork that remains a shocking sensation.",

Instead she finds herself stuck in desperate singlehood, spending her days working in the legendary British bookshop, Shakespeare & Co in Paris, rather than pursuing her own ambitions of becoming a novelist. But when an unexpected invitation to the Jane Austen Writers' Residency in England lands in her lap, Agathe is in for an eye-opening and life-changing experience. Encouraged to confront her insecurities and explore her true romantic, sexual and creative nature, in part thanks to her eccentric co-residents, Agathe realises it’s time to stop wasting her sentimental life and take control - over both her writing aspirations, and her very own love story.\n\nStarring Camille Rutherford (Anatomy of a Fall), Pablo Pauly (The French Dispatch) and Charlie Anson (Death on the Nile), Jane Austen Wrecked My Life is an uplifting and heart-warming throwback to classic romance, with a modern sensibility, marking the directorial debut of acclaimed screenwriter Laura Piani.",

      "synopsis": "A love triangle of jealousy in the Parisian art scene of the 1930s is brought to life in a stylish docufiction about iconic artist and architect Eileen Gray, who built her modernist dream house on the Riviera, only to be upstaged by Le Corbusier.\r\n\r\nEileen Gray had a truly eminent sense of design. The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Screening in partnership with The Architecture Club.",

Haneke finds his match in Isabelle Huppert, who delivers an icy but quietly seething performance as Erika, a middle-aged piano professor at a Viennese conservatory who lives with her mother, in a claustrophobically codependent relationship. Severely repressed, she satisfies her masochistic urges only voyeuristically until she meets Walter (Benoît Magimel), a young student whose desire for Erika leads to a destructive infatuation that upsets the careful equilibrium of her life. A critical breakthrough for Haneke, The Piano Teacher—which won the Grand Prix as well as dual acting awards for its stars at Cannes—is a formalist masterwork that remains a shocking sensation.",

Instead she finds herself stuck in desperate singlehood, spending her days working in the legendary British bookshop, Shakespeare & Co in Paris, rather than pursuing her own ambitions of becoming a novelist. But when an unexpected invitation to the Jane Austen Writers' Residency in England lands in her lap, Agathe is in for an eye-opening and life-changing experience. Encouraged to confront her insecurities and explore her true romantic, sexual and creative nature, in part thanks to her eccentric co-residents, Agathe realises it’s time to stop wasting her sentimental life and take control - over both her writing aspirations, and her very own love story.\n\nStarring Camille Rutherford (Anatomy of a Fall), Pablo Pauly (The French Dispatch) and Charlie Anson (Death on the Nile), Jane Austen Wrecked My Life is an uplifting and heart-warming throwback to classic romance, with a modern sensibility, marking the directorial debut of acclaimed screenwriter Laura Piani.",

      "synopsis": "A love triangle of jealousy in the Parisian art scene of the 1930s is brought to life in a stylish docufiction about iconic artist and architect Eileen Gray, who built her modernist dream house on the Riviera, only to be upstaged by Le Corbusier.\r\n\r\nEileen Gray had a truly eminent sense of design. The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Screening in partnership with The Architecture Club.",

It’s been almost three decades since the rage virus escaped a biological weapons laboratory, and now, still in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found ways to exist amidst the infected. One such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one of the group leaves the island on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors as well.",

Severely repressed, she satisfies her masochistic urges only voyeuristically until she meets Walter (Benoît Magimel), a young student whose desire for Erika leads to a destructive infatuation that upsets the careful equilibrium of her life. A critical breakthrough for Haneke, The Piano Teacher—which won the Grand Prix as well as dual acting awards for its stars at Cannes—is a formalist masterwork that remains a shocking sensation.",

Featuring a cast of top acting talent, including Isabelle Huppert, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Mathieu Kassovitz and Toby Jones, it’s a piercing dark comedy on the blind preoccupations of middle-class angst.\n\nWhen her mother falls ill under mysterious circumstances, young Eve (Fantine Harduin) is sent to live with her estranged father’s relatives in Calais. The Laurent family – wealthy, neurotic and self-obsessed – own a lucrative construction company and live in a sprawling mansion house, waited on by servants. But trouble is brewing, as a series of intergenerational back-stabbings threaten to tear the family apart. Meanwhile, distracted by infidelities and betrayals, they fail to notice that their new arrival has a sinister secret of her own.\n\nNominated for the Palme d’Or at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, Happy End bears all the hallmarks of Haneke’s uniquely stark and unsympathetic style. Pairing pitch-black humour with chillingly precise direction, it’s proof – if we ever needed it – that he remains one of modern cinema’s true visionaries.",

Instead she finds herself stuck in desperate singlehood, spending her days working in the legendary British bookshop, Shakespeare & Co in Paris, rather than pursuing her own ambitions of becoming a novelist. But when an unexpected invitation to the Jane Austen Writers' Residency in England lands in her lap, Agathe is in for an eye-opening and life-changing experience. Encouraged to confront her insecurities and explore her true romantic, sexual and creative nature, in part thanks to her eccentric co-residents, Agathe realises it’s time to stop wasting her sentimental life and take control - over both her writing aspirations, and her very own love story.\n\nStarring Camille Rutherford (Anatomy of a Fall), Pablo Pauly (The French Dispatch) and Charlie Anson (Death on the Nile), Jane Austen Wrecked My Life is an uplifting and heart-warming throwback to classic romance, with a modern sensibility, marking the directorial debut of acclaimed screenwriter Laura Piani.",

But behind his much-loved persona as the wholesome 'Painter of Light' were demons that would drive him to alcoholism and scandal.\r\n\r\nA vault of unseen, unexpectedly dark paintings, discovered only after his death, offers a key to an unknown side of Kinkade, unraveling the chocolate-box life he had presented to a middle America so desperate to buy it.\r\n\r\nIn ART FOR EVERYBODY, Miranda Yousef peels back the layers of Kinkade’s facade to reveal a more complex and troubled man than his public ever knew.",

It’s been almost three decades since the rage virus escaped a biological weapons laboratory, and now, still in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found ways to exist amidst the infected. One such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one of the group leaves the island on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors as well.",

Despite daily shelling, Anya finds resistance and purpose in her art, Andrey takes the dangerous journey to get his young family to safety abroad, and Slava becomes a weapons instructor for ordinary people who have become unlikely soldiers. As the war intensifies, Andrey picks up his camera to film their story, and on tiny porcelain figurines, Anya and Slava capture their idyllic past, uncertain present, and hope for the future.",
