      "synopsis": "Two-time Academy Award® winner RENÉE ZELLWEGER returns to the role that established a romantic-comedy heroine for the ages, a woman whose inimitable approach to life and love redefined an entire film genre.\n\nBridget Jones first exploded onto bookshelves in HELEN FIELDING’s literary phenomenon Bridget Jones’s Diary, which became a global bestseller and a blockbuster film. As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n",

He crosses paths with Yuval, an Israeli journalist who joins his struggle, and for over half a decade they fight against the expulsion while growing closer. Their complex bond is haunted by the extreme inequality between them: Basel, living under a brutal military occupation, and Yuval, unrestricted and free. This film, by a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four young activists, was co-created during the darkest, most terrifying times in the region, as an act of creative resistance to Apartheid and a search for a path towards equality and justice.",

They abandon their current lives for different reasons - for some it's about evading danger, for others it's about escaping the shame of failure. They are known as the Johatsu, or 'the evaporated'.\r\n\r\nDirectors Andreas Hartmann and Arata Mori approach the phenomenon of Johatsu sensitively, interweaving the stories of people who have left their lives with those of loved ones who have been left behind, and following the owner of a 'night moving' company, who helps her clients set up new lives without leaving a trace.\r\n\r\nJOHATSU: INTO THIN AIR paints a multifaceted portrait of a complex phenomenon, reflecting on what society allows and what is rejected.",

He crosses paths with Yuval, an Israeli journalist who joins his struggle, and for over half a decade they fight against the expulsion while growing closer. Their complex bond is haunted by the extreme inequality between them: Basel, living under a brutal military occupation, and Yuval, unrestricted and free. \r\n\r\nThis film, by a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four young activists, was co-created during the darkest, most terrifying times in the region, as an act of creative resistance to Apartheid and a search for a path towards equality and justice.",

As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n",

As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n",

As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n",

As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n",

Their complex bond is haunted by the extreme inequality between them: Basel, living under a brutal military occupation, and Yuval, unrestricted and free. This film, by a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four young activists, was co-created during the darkest, most terrifying times in the region, as an act of creative resistance to Apartheid and a search for a path towards equality and justice.",

      "synopsis": "Two-time Academy Award® winner RENÉE ZELLWEGER returns to the role that established a romantic-comedy heroine for the ages, a woman whose inimitable approach to life and love redefined an entire film genre.\n\nBridget Jones first exploded onto bookshelves in HELEN FIELDING’s literary phenomenon Bridget Jones’s Diary, which became a global bestseller and a blockbuster film. As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n",
