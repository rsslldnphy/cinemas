      "synopsis": "A love triangle of jealousy in the Parisian art scene of the 1930s is brought to life in a stylish docufiction about iconic artist and architect Eileen Gray, who built her modernist dream house on the Riviera, only to be upstaged by Le Corbusier.\r\n\r\nEileen Gray had a truly eminent sense of design. The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Screening in partnership with The Architecture Club.",

Hollywood director and comedian Steve Pink - himself a far left progressive - profiles Kinzinger during his last year in Congress as he, seemingly alone amongst Republicans, takes a stand. \r\n\r\nWhile Pink persistently challenges Kinzinger on his political views, he forms a surprisingly humourous friendship with his conservative Christian counterpart.

      "synopsis": "A love triangle of jealousy in the Parisian art scene of the 1930s is brought to life in a stylish docufiction about iconic artist and architect Eileen Gray, who built her modernist dream house on the Riviera, only to be upstaged by Le Corbusier.\r\n\r\nEileen Gray had a truly eminent sense of design. The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Screening in partnership with The Architecture Club.",

Born in the Bay of Naples in 1950, Parthenope (Celeste Dalla Porta) searches for happiness over the long summers of her youth, falling in love with her home city and its many memorable characters.

Featuring a captivating performance from Dalla Porta and an outstanding cast that includes Gary Oldman, PARTHENOPE is another tale of great beauty from a master of modern cinema.",

      "synopsis": "A love triangle of jealousy in the Parisian art scene of the 1930s is brought to life in a stylish docufiction about iconic artist and architect Eileen Gray, who built her modernist dream house on the Riviera, only to be upstaged by Le Corbusier.\r\n\r\nEileen Gray had a truly eminent sense of design. The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Screening in partnership with The Architecture Club.",

Yet the story is one of optimism, with Attenborough pointing to inspirational stories from around the world to deliver his greatest message: the ocean can recover to a glory beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\n\nScreening in cinemas with theatrically exclusive footage.",

The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Screening in partnership with The Architecture Club.",

      "synopsis": "A love triangle of jealousy in the Parisian art scene of the 1930s is brought to life in a stylish docufiction about iconic artist and architect Eileen Gray, who built her modernist dream house on the Riviera, only to be upstaged by Le Corbusier.\r\n\r\nEileen Gray had a truly eminent sense of design. The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Screening in partnership with The Architecture Club.",

At the heart a song, an argument between life and death, each stating their case to rule over the world. The film is without exposition, it aims at something less recognisable, a different existence of reality observed in discrete moments. A sequel to Two Years at Sea (2011), charting a subtly changing life in a radically changing world.",
