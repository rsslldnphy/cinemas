The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Screening in partnership with The Architecture Club.",

Hollywood director and comedian Steve Pink - himself a far left progressive - profiles Kinzinger during his last year in Congress as he, seemingly alone amongst Republicans, takes a stand. \r\n\r\nWhile Pink persistently challenges Kinzinger on his political views, he forms a surprisingly humourous friendship with his conservative Christian counterpart.

Anchored by an as-it-was-happening interview with Herzog himself, BURDEN OF DREAMS is a wild insight into his unflinching vision and the lengths he would go to to realise it.",

Through spectacular sequences featuring coral reefs, kelp forests and the open ocean, Attenborough shares why a healthy ocean keeps the entire planet stable and flourishing.\n\nStunning, immersive cinematography showcases the wonder of life under the seas and exposes the realities and challenges facing our ocean as never-before-seen, from destructive fishing techniques to mass coral reef bleaching. Yet the story is one of optimism, with Attenborough pointing to inspirational stories from around the world to deliver his greatest message: the ocean can recover to a glory beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\n\nScreening in cinemas with theatrically exclusive footage.",

Anchored by an as-it-was-happening interview with Herzog himself, BURDEN OF DREAMS is a wild insight into his unflinching vision and the lengths he would go to to realise it.",

Born in the Bay of Naples in 1950, Parthenope (Celeste Dalla Porta) searches for happiness over the long summers of her youth, falling in love with her home city and its many memorable characters. But when tragedy strikes, and carefree romances lose their thrill, she decides to seek a deeper sense of purpose. Featuring a captivating performance from Dalla Porta and an outstanding cast that includes Gary Oldman, PARTHENOPE is another tale of great beauty from a master of modern cinema.",

      "synopsis": "A love triangle of jealousy in the Parisian art scene of the 1930s is brought to life in a stylish docufiction about iconic artist and architect Eileen Gray, who built her modernist dream house on the Riviera, only to be upstaged by Le Corbusier.\r\n\r\nEileen Gray had a truly eminent sense of design. The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Screening in partnership with The Architecture Club.",

Hollywood director and comedian Steve Pink - himself a far left progressive - profiles Kinzinger during his last year in Congress as he, seemingly alone amongst Republicans, takes a stand. \r\n\r\nWhile Pink persistently challenges Kinzinger on his political views, he forms a surprisingly humourous friendship with his conservative Christian counterpart.

      "synopsis": "A love triangle of jealousy in the Parisian art scene of the 1930s is brought to life in a stylish docufiction about iconic artist and architect Eileen Gray, who built her modernist dream house on the Riviera, only to be upstaged by Le Corbusier.\r\n\r\nEileen Gray had a truly eminent sense of design. The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Screening in partnership with The Architecture Club.",

At the heart a song, an argument between life and death, each stating their case to rule over the world. The film is without exposition, it aims at something less recognisable, a different existence of reality observed in discrete moments. A sequel to Two Years at Sea (2011), charting a subtly changing life in a radically changing world.",

But echoes of the three wars his family have lived through since 1992 are ever-present. His grandmother laments the cycle of ethnic violence: ‘Living in Artsakh means that one day there will be a war and my grandson will participate in that war’. \r\n\r\nAs his school lessons become increasingly militarised and Vrej struggles to hold on to his childhood dreams, his grandmother watches her prophecy unfold.",

Alas, with the population in rapid decline, this bucolic way of life seems closer and closer to its final days. Through quiet yet sharp observation, director Eliza Petkova weaves in a lyrical — and oftentimes comic — portrayal of this insulated community through the eyes of the animals surrounding them, from a mischievous black and white cat to a small lamb struggling to put on weight.",

In the aftermath, she seeks comfort and support from her brother Adrian, whose kneejerk judgemental reaction only further burdens her with guilt. Their relationship, now irrefutably changed, gets murkier and murkier as Adrian becomes consumed with rage and Alex distances herself further from reality and deeper into playing the role of Medea on stage. A superbly paced and acted feature debut, Fury surgically broaches questions of shame, guilt, and impotency as Blasco confidently escalates tension to a boiling point.",
