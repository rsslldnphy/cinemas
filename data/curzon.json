When she summons the courage to unveil her own story, Sanjivani finds inspiration in their shared resilience and the empowerment forged from their common experiences. Can Sanjivani’s newly-found voice shift adversity into opportunity? Are solidarity and friendships enough to quietly fuel a mental-health revolution?",

Working through her award-winning documentary collective, Docmakers, veteran filmmaker Raes (0.03 Seconde, Two Men, Close to Vermeer) carves out a disarmingly tender rumination on parent-child relationships.\r\n\r\nGiving equal weight to each sibling, balancing the light and shade of the physical and emotional spaces of their lives, Where Dragons Live also features some dazzling visuals in the way it presents this personal history.",

At a time when diversity initiatives in the USA are being scrapped by President Trump’s decree, and Elon Musk is retweeting Ben Chapiro's call for the police officer who murdered George Floyd to be pardoned, this film explores how his death became one of the most significant moments of our time.\n\n \n\nIt also questions whether enough has been achieved since then and what needs to happen next. Capturing a UK-wide perspective, we will see how Floyd’s murder was a moment of reckoning, not only in the US but also in the UK which sparked the BLM movement.",

Born in the Bay of Naples in 1950, Parthenope (Celeste Dalla Porta) searches for happiness over the long summers of her youth, falling in love with her home city and its many memorable characters.

Featuring a captivating performance from Dalla Porta and an outstanding cast that includes Gary Oldman, PARTHENOPE is another tale of great beauty from a master of modern cinema.",

The production showcases bespoke instruments, including a magnetic harp, a circular flute, an aluphone, and a reverb chamber, and Björk is furthermore joined on stage by musical director and multi-instrumentalist Bergur Þórisson, percussionist Manu Delago, flute septet Viibra, harpist Katie Buckley and the Hamrahlid choir. Digitally animated moving curtains create a modern lanterna magica for live music, transforming 21st-century VR visuals into the grandeur of a 19th-century theatre — and now into an immersive cinema experience, enhanced by meticulously crafted Dolby Atmos spatial audio.\n \nDirected by Ísold Uggadóttir, the film features sound and visual creative direction, music arrangements, production, and performance by Björk. It showcases the work of James Merry as co-creative director of visuals, and original animation by Tobias Gremmler – with additional contributions from Andrew Thomas Huang, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir, Pierre-Alain Giraud, Nick Knight, and Warren Du Preez & Nick Thornton-Jones.\n \nCornucopia sees Björk pushing the boundaries of live performance, offering a visually and sonically immersive experience unlike anything seen before.",

The first part in the programme, CLASS RUPTURES, features EGYPT, THE CITY OF THE DEAD (1977), THE CROSS OF THE PHARAOHS (1986) and THE GHOSTS OF ALEXANDRIA (1986). These new restorations are shown for the first time at Open City.",

Like all good fairy tales – this work edges light with the dark as Thom's echoed chants intertwine with Mark's shimmering electronics on top of Jonathan’s hyperreal environments. On Tall Tales, we hear seasoned musicians continue down the path of experimentation, juxtaposed with uneasy landscapes of natural beauty and the brutal aesthetics of a dystopian world. Through Yorke’s lyrics, Pritchard’s atemporal compositions and Zawada’s visuals, Tall Tales questions where our insatiable appetite for ‘progress’ might have landed us. A prophetic cinematic experience, Tall Tales has been years in the making, but delivered right on time.",

Working through her award-winning documentary collective, Docmakers, veteran filmmaker Raes (0.03 Seconde, Two Men, Close to Vermeer) carves out a disarmingly tender rumination on parent-child relationships.\r\n\r\nGiving equal weight to each sibling, balancing the light and shade of the physical and emotional spaces of their lives, Where Dragons Live also features some dazzling visuals in the way it presents this personal history.",
