      "synopsis": "A love triangle of jealousy in the Parisian art scene of the 1930s is brought to life in a stylish docufiction about iconic artist and architect Eileen Gray, who built her modernist dream house on the Riviera, only to be upstaged by Le Corbusier.\r\n\r\nEileen Gray had a truly eminent sense of design. The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Screening in partnership with The Architecture Club.",

Yet the story is one of optimism, with Attenborough pointing to inspirational stories from around the world to deliver his greatest message: the ocean can recover to a glory beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\n\nScreening in cinemas with theatrically exclusive footage.",

With depleted resources, only a tent and some essentials between them, every step along the path is a testament to their growing strength and determination. THE SALT PATH is a journey that is exhilarating, challenging, and liberating in equal measure. A portrayal of home, how it can be lost and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.",

The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Screening in partnership with The Architecture Club.",

      "synopsis": "A love triangle of jealousy in the Parisian art scene of the 1930s is brought to life in a stylish docufiction about iconic artist and architect Eileen Gray, who built her modernist dream house on the Riviera, only to be upstaged by Le Corbusier.\r\n\r\nEileen Gray had a truly eminent sense of design. The Irish artist and architect created some of the most iconic furniture of the 20th century, so when she focussed her unique artistic vision on developing a house for herself on the Riviera in 1929, the result was a modernist triumph. A house and a work of art in one, overlooking the sun-sparkled infinity of the Mediterranean. The house is named E.1027, a cryptic contraction of the names of Gray and her lover, Romanian architect Jean Badovici. But when the Swiss-French star architect Le Corbusier learns of the house, he becomes obsessed – perhaps because Gray breathes light, air and soul into her building, which is not just a machine to live in.\r\n\r\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA reconstructs the dramatic story of Gray and the house that Le Corbusier amazingly managed to convince the world he had built himself. A stunningly beautiful and cinematic docufiction where the inspiration from Gray is present in lines, colours and shapes – but where they serve the narrative of a brilliant female artist who spent a long life in the shadow of her male colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe screening on Wed 4 Jun will be followed by a Q&A with director Beatrice Minger and actor Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Screening in partnership with The Architecture Club.",

      "synopsis": "About to turn 80, retired actor Lucjan (Maciej Damiecki) is admitted by his son into what appears to be a peaceful nursing home nestled in the quiet countryside. The son is about to become a father himself and says it is only temporary, but Lucjan soon begins to be confronted with sinister signs that his stay might be more permanent than it seems. With Night Silence, Hellhole director Bartosz M. Kowalski finely walks the line between the tender and the eerie as existential conversations about love and loss happen as mysterious creatures crawl under the creaking floors. ",

Seesawing between bold, dreamlike reconstructions of Bergdorf’s childhood and honest testimonials on her experience being swept under the relentless scrutiny of the UK media, Love & Rage sensitively employs the vulnerability of Bergdorf’s personal life and experiences to investigate ever-vital systemic issues of transphobia, homophobia, and racism, all while reiterating the importance of community and painting a portrayal of what modern activism looks like. It is an inspiring insight into the resilience required of a trailblazer. ",

They all agree to enter the train not as themselves, but as carefully designed characters in a role-playing game. This premise, which kicks off Sunshine Express, proves a fertile allegory to examine the cogs of totalitarian systems and how authoritarianism often survives through not only shared complicity but a cruelly enforced sense of otherness. By drinking from the fountains of Bong Joon-ho and Jafar Panahi, Navaee crafts a tense, deeply nuanced political thriller in this promising feature debut. ",

The Life of Chuck is the third of his collaborations with Stephen King, whose work he previously adapted in Gerald’s Game and Doctor Sleep. Less interested in scares than in life affirming sincerity, the film is a cosy science fiction tale of an extraordinary ordinary man called Charles Kantz, ever present in the lives of every citizen of a town on the brink of apocalypse. The less said the better. The film unfolds like an uplifting  reminder that everyone contains multitudes. ",
