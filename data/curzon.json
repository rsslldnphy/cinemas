As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n",

As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n",

      "synopsis": "Two-time Academy Award® winner RENÉE ZELLWEGER returns to the role that established a romantic-comedy heroine for the ages, a woman whose inimitable approach to life and love redefined an entire film genre.\n\nBridget Jones first exploded onto bookshelves in HELEN FIELDING’s literary phenomenon Bridget Jones’s Diary, which became a global bestseller and a blockbuster film. As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n",

It also follows the story of Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prominent political activist who survived two poisonings and now finds himself on trial accused of treason, and a whistleblower from deep inside Russia's poison programme as he attempts a near-impossible escape.\r\n\r\nPlaying out like a spy thriller itself, ANITDOTE has a critical resonance for the UK, where a Russian spy ring currently stand trial, accused of targeting Grozev amongst others, and the shadow of the Novichok poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury still looms large.",

As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n",

Basel documents the gradual erasure of Masafer Yatta, as soldiers destroy the homes of families - the largest single act of forced transfer ever carried out in the occupied West Bank. He crosses paths with Yuval, an Israeli journalist who joins his struggle, and for over half a decade they fight against the expulsion while growing closer. Their complex bond is haunted by the extreme inequality between them: Basel, living under a brutal military occupation, and Yuval, unrestricted and free. \r\n\r\nThis film, by a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four young activists, was co-created during the darkest, most terrifying times in the region, as an act of creative resistance to Apartheid and a search for a path towards equality and justice.",

Traditionally a male domain, war art by women has been largely unrecognised. Until now...\r\n\r\nCulture breaks the taboo, crosses borders - tells the truth to power. Artists featured include Dame Rachel Whiteread, Zhanna Kadyrova, Maggi Hambling, Assil Diab, Dame Laura Knight, Marcelle Hanselaar, Cornelia Parker, Maya Lin, Shirin Neshat and Lee Miller. An entirely female cast of contributors makes this film a unique undertaking – telling vital truths in turbulent times.\r\n\r\nWar Paint – Women At War is the third instalment in Kinmonth’s trilogy of films about how artists depict war, following the acclaimed Eric Ravilious – Drawn To War and War Art with Eddie Redmayne.

Traditionally a male domain, war art by women has been largely unrecognised. Until now...\r\n\r\nCulture breaks the taboo, crosses borders - tells the truth to power. Artists featured include Dame Rachel Whiteread, Zhanna Kadyrova, Maggi Hambling, Assil Diab, Dame Laura Knight, Marcelle Hanselaar, Cornelia Parker, Maya Lin, Shirin Neshat and Lee Miller. An entirely female cast of contributors makes this film a unique undertaking – telling vital truths in turbulent times.\r\n\r\nWar Paint – Women At War is the third instalment in Kinmonth’s trilogy of films about how artists depict war, following the acclaimed Eric Ravilious – Drawn To War and War Art with Eddie Redmayne.

Artists featured include Dame Rachel Whiteread, Zhanna Kadyrova, Maggi Hambling, Assil Diab, Dame Laura Knight, Marcelle Hanselaar, Cornelia Parker, Maya Lin, Shirin Neshat and Lee Miller. An entirely female cast of contributors makes this film a unique undertaking – telling vital truths in turbulent times.\r\n\r\nWar Paint – Women At War is the third instalment in Kinmonth’s trilogy of films about how artists depict war, following the acclaimed Eric Ravilious – Drawn To War and War Art with Eddie Redmayne.

Traditionally a male domain, war art by women has been largely unrecognised. Until now...\r\n\r\nCulture breaks the taboo, crosses borders - tells the truth to power. Artists featured include Dame Rachel Whiteread, Zhanna Kadyrova, Maggi Hambling, Assil Diab, Dame Laura Knight, Marcelle Hanselaar, Cornelia Parker, Maya Lin, Shirin Neshat and Lee Miller. An entirely female cast of contributors makes this film a unique undertaking – telling vital truths in turbulent times.\r\n\r\nWar Paint – Women At War is the third instalment in Kinmonth’s trilogy of films about how artists depict war, following the acclaimed Eric Ravilious – Drawn To War and War Art with Eddie Redmayne.

In the shadow of mortality, each with a long and dramatic life behind them, the hard truths of life together provoke in Maggie and Joel an attempt to find a shared inner-peace while there is still time.\r\n",

At the same time, they highlight the dangers faced by journalists reporting from the frontline of their local communities. Hundreds have gone missing in recent years, many reported murdered. Each of the stories in Santiago Maza’s urgent film contributes to the tapestry of collusion between organised crime and corrupt officials in all areas of government. It’s a reminder that the people who put their lives on the line, bringing us stories that matter, need protection and there is no acceptable solution that does not include the cooperation of the Mexican government and involvement from international bodies.\r\n",

It also follows the story of Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prominent political activist who survived two poisonings and now finds himself on trial accused of treason, and a whistleblower from deep inside Russia's poison programme as he attempts a near-impossible escape.\r\n\r\nPlaying out like a spy thriller itself, ANITDOTE has a critical resonance for the UK, where a Russian spy ring currently stand trial, accused of targeting Grozev amongst others, and the shadow of the Novichok poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury still looms large.",
