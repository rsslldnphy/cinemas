Following on from his previous, hybrid feature The Filmmaker's House (2020), This Blessed Plot is Isaacs' attempt to innovate by remaining outside conventional industrial film production structures. He works with people from some of his past docs and new characters he has encountered in Thaxted.",

But both her methodology and her message came under criticism in the backlash from this popularity, and slowly but surely Shere was ridiculed and squeezed out of the mainstream - and eventually out of popular consciousness.\r\n\r\nDirector Nicole Newnham (Crip Camp) recovers Shere Hite from the margins of history, feminism and academia, exploring the charismatic former model's rise and fall from prominence. Using a treasure trove of archive footage, The Disappearance of Shere Hite transports viewers back to a time of great societal change and transformation around sexuality. It rediscovers a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations around gender and sexuality, and asks what led to Shere's erasure.",

But both her methodology and her message came under criticism in the backlash from this popularity, and slowly but surely Shere was ridiculed and squeezed out of the mainstream - and eventually out of popular consciousness.\r\n\r\nDirector Nicole Newnham (Crip Camp) recovers Shere Hite from the margins of history, feminism and academia, exploring the charismatic former model's rise and fall from prominence. Using a treasure trove of archive footage, The Disappearance of Shere Hite transports viewers back to a time of great societal change and transformation around sexuality. It rediscovers a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations around gender and sexuality, and asks what led to Shere's erasure.",

It is stories like these that have made this most remarkable director a cult figure the world over.\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive portrait by director Thomas von Steinaecke explores Herzog's work, process and everyday life, bringing together rare archive materials and in-depth interviews with the man himself, as well as celebrated collaborators - including Joshua Oppenheimer, Patti Smith, Christian Bale, Nicole Kidman and his wife, Lena Herzog.",

Eventually he forms an unlikely bond with one of them -- a damaged, brainy troublemaker (newcomer Dominic Sessa) -- and with the school’s head cook, who lost a son in Vietnam (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). With outstanding critical acclaim, The Holdovers is now the winner of 2 Golden Globes for Best Actor (Comedy) for Paul Giamatti and Best Supporting Actress for Da’Vine Joy Randolph.",

Eventually he forms an unlikely bond with one of them -- a damaged, brainy troublemaker (newcomer Dominic Sessa) -- and with the school’s head cook, who lost a son in Vietnam (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). With outstanding critical acclaim, The Holdovers is now the winner of 2 Golden Globes for Best Actor (Comedy) for Paul Giamatti and Best Supporting Actress for Da’Vine Joy Randolph.",

Using a treasure trove of archive footage, The Disappearance of Shere Hite transports viewers back to a time of great societal change and transformation around sexuality. It rediscovers a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations around gender and sexuality, and asks what led to Shere's erasure.",

But they do love heroes... so when a modern, first-person shooter game arrives featuring tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun, Ralph sees it as his ticket to heroism and happiness. He sneaks into the game with a simple plan -- win a medal -- but soon wrecks everything, and accidentally unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens every game in the arcade. Ralph's only hope? Vanellope von Schweetz, a young troublemaking \"glitch\" from a candy-coated cart racing game who might just be the one to teach Ralph what it means to be a Good Guy. But will he realize he is good enough to become a hero before it's \"Game Over\" for the entire arcade?",
