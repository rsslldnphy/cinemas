Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",

Her beautifully-constructed film diary captures the joy, music and defiance of this hidden life, navigating the contrast between unseen freedom and external oppression.",

Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",
