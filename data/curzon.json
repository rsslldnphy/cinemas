Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",

Democracy was hard-baked into young Arum's world view, but, confronted with the Sewol ferry disaster at the age of 18, she begins question the system crafted by her parents' generation.\r\n\r\nWith the lightest of touches, Arum's playful, personal film explores recent Korean history and the complexities of family dynamics. As an emerging filmmaker, Arum must reevaluate the paths her once-idealistic parents have taken, and consider the responsibilities of her own generation.",

Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",

Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",

Her beautifully-constructed film diary captures the joy, music and defiance of this hidden life, navigating the contrast between unseen freedom and external oppression.",

Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",
