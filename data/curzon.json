Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",

Director Alessandra Celesia unearths the emotional wounds left on the families remaining on the estate – the legacy of political violence. As protagonist Joe grapples with personal tragedy, including the murder of his teenage uncle, his story intertwines with those of his neighbours: Angie, haunted by a violent past, and Jolene, who finds solace in music. Through moving reconstructions, testimonies and archival footage, Celesia’s profound and deeply human film reveals the ways unresolved trauma endures and changes across generations.",

Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time.\n\nAt the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.",

Director Alessandra Celesia unearths the emotional wounds left on the families remaining on the estate – the legacy of political violence. As protagonist Joe grapples with personal tragedy, including the murder of his teenage uncle, his story intertwines with those of his neighbours: Angie, haunted by a violent past, and Jolene, who finds solace in music. Through moving reconstructions, testimonies and archival footage, Celesia’s profound and deeply human film reveals the ways unresolved trauma endures and changes across generations.",

THE BIBI FILES is a film about a man singularly focused on his own political survival in a region beset by war.\r\n\r\nLeaked footage from police interrogation videos are interwoven with archival footage that shows Netanyahu’s rise to power, and how his nearly 30-year rule as Prime Minister has divided the state of Israel. Interspersed throughout are interviews with prominent journalists, Israeli statesmen, Netanyahu's associates, and longtime friends, whose observations and anecdotes reveal a chilling portrait of a leader who, in his drive to evade justice, has aligned himself with radical right-wing extremists. Netanyahu’s fixation on his entitlement to remain Prime Minister has, in this way, led to political decisions that have endangered Israel’s safety, and destroyed her standing as a democracy in the Middle East.\r\n",

Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time.\n\nAt the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.",

Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time.\n\nAt the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.",

Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.",

In emulation of these summer trips the director returns to visit as an adult, challenging his teenage belief that ‘going to Ain el-Helweh is better than going to Disney Land’. As when he was young, Fleifel is enamoured by the spirit of passion, volatility and camaraderie in the camp, yet he is forced to realise the harsher realities of entrapment and desperation his childhood friends face.\r\n \r\nA bittersweet cinematic essay, A WORLD NOT OURS is a refreshing look at the friendships, laughter, hope and despair that comprise daily life for those living in exile in Lebanon’s refugee camps.",

Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time.\n\nAt the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.",

Director Alessandra Celesia unearths the emotional wounds left on the families remaining on the estate – the legacy of political violence. As protagonist Joe grapples with personal tragedy, including the murder of his teenage uncle, his story intertwines with those of his neighbours: Angie, haunted by a violent past, and Jolene, who finds solace in music. Through moving reconstructions, testimonies and archival footage, Celesia’s profound and deeply human film reveals the ways unresolved trauma endures and changes across generations.",

Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time.\n\nAt the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.",

Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time.\n\nAt the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.",

      "synopsis": "A Siberian mother-of-three turns citizen journalist, in this investigative thriller that skims dangerously close to the coercive grip of the Russian government.\r\n\r\nIn a country that prioritises the coal industry over the public and where the State controls the media, the residents of a remote mining town have nowhere to turn when their air becomes toxic and coal dust turns the snow black.\r\n\r\nIncensed at the cover-ups and lies, Natalia Zubkova live streams her investigations as she uncovers the full extent of the environmental disaster unfolding around her.\r\n\r\nFilmed over the course of four turbulent years, this taut and revelatory eco-thriller is in turn enraging and nailbiting, as Natalia is subjected to the clandestine tactics of Russia’s modern surveillance state.",

      "trailer": null,
      "synopsis": "The New Lodge flats are located in a predominantly working class, Catholic district of Northern Ireland’s capital. The area remains marked by its tragically high death toll during the Troubles, the country’s 30-year conflict that took place between the 1960s and late 1990s. Director Alessandra Celesia unearths the emotional wounds left on the families remaining on the estate – the legacy of political violence. As protagonist Joe grapples with personal tragedy, including the murder of his teenage uncle, his story intertwines with those of his neighbours: Angie, haunted by a violent past, and Jolene, who finds solace in music. Through moving reconstructions, testimonies and archival footage, Celesia’s profound and deeply human film reveals the ways unresolved trauma endures and changes across generations.",
