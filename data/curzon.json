Director Alessandra Celesia unearths the emotional wounds left on the families remaining on the estate – the legacy of political violence. As protagonist Joe grapples with personal tragedy, including the murder of his teenage uncle, his story intertwines with those of his neighbours: Angie, haunted by a violent past, and Jolene, who finds solace in music. Through moving reconstructions, testimonies and archival footage, Celesia’s profound and deeply human film reveals the ways unresolved trauma endures and changes across generations.",

Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",

Democracy was hard-baked into young Arum's world view, but, confronted with the Sewol ferry disaster at the age of 18, she begins question the system crafted by her parents' generation.\r\n\r\nWith the lightest of touches, Arum's playful, personal film explores recent Korean history and the complexities of family dynamics.

      "synopsis": "Using her own home movies and a trove of collected 8mm archive, Iranian filmmaker Farahnaz Sharifi reveals the dual existences lived by women in Iran.\r\n\r\nSharifi was born during the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979, and finds her life divided between a public world of silence and submission, and the domestic world that she shares with other women behind closed doors. Her beautifully-constructed film diary captures the joy, music and defiance of this hidden life, navigating the contrast between unseen freedom and external oppression.",

Her younger, flightier and rebellious roommate, Anu, tries in vain to find a spot in the city to be intimate with her secret boyfriend. Their colleague Parvaty fights to stay in her home without any requisite paperwork left by her late husband. A trip to a beach town allows them each to find a space for their desires to manifest. \n\nPayal Kapadia’s hugely acclaimed fiction debut was the first Indian film to be selected in Official Competition at Cannes in three decades, where it was awarded the Grand Prix.\n",

These microscopic particles drift in the air, float in all bodies of water, and mix into the soil, becoming a permanent part of the environment.\r\n\r\nNow, scientists are finding these particles in our bodies. What is the impact of these invisible invaders on our health? And can anything be done about it?\r\n\r\nAcclaimed author and science journalist Ziya Tong takes a personal approach by visiting leading scientists around the world and undergoing experiments in her home, on her food, and her body. This is an eye-opening wake-up call for all of us to rethink our relationship with plastic.",

Democracy was hard-baked into young Arum's world view, but, confronted with the Sewol ferry disaster at the age of 18, she begins question the system crafted by her parents' generation.\r\n\r\nWith the lightest of touches, Arum's playful, personal film explores recent Korean history and the complexities of family dynamics. As an emerging filmmaker, Arum must reevaluate the paths her once-idealistic parents have taken, and consider the responsibilities of her own generation.",

THE BIBI FILES is a film about a man singularly focused on his own political survival in a region beset by war.\r\n\r\nLeaked footage from police interrogation videos are interwoven with archival footage that shows Netanyahu’s rise to power, and how his nearly 30-year rule as Prime Minister has divided the state of Israel. Interspersed throughout are interviews with prominent journalists, Israeli statesmen, Netanyahu's associates, and longtime friends, whose observations and anecdotes reveal a chilling portrait of a leader who, in his drive to evade justice, has aligned himself with radical right-wing extremists. Netanyahu’s fixation on his entitlement to remain Prime Minister has, in this way, led to political decisions that have endangered Israel’s safety, and destroyed her standing as a democracy in the Middle East.\r\n",

      "synopsis": "The New Lodge flats are located in a predominantly working class, Catholic district of Northern Ireland’s capital. The area remains marked by its tragically high death toll during the Troubles, the country’s 30-year conflict that took place between the 1960s and late 1990s. Director Alessandra Celesia unearths the emotional wounds left on the families remaining on the estate – the legacy of political violence. As protagonist Joe grapples with personal tragedy, including the murder of his teenage uncle, his story intertwines with those of his neighbours: Angie, haunted by a violent past, and Jolene, who finds solace in music. Through moving reconstructions, testimonies and archival footage, Celesia’s profound and deeply human film reveals the ways unresolved trauma endures and changes across generations.",

THE BIBI FILES is a film about a man singularly focused on his own political survival in a region beset by war.\r\n\r\nLeaked footage from police interrogation videos are interwoven with archival footage that shows Netanyahu’s rise to power, and how his nearly 30-year rule as Prime Minister has divided the state of Israel. Interspersed throughout are interviews with prominent journalists, Israeli statesmen, Netanyahu's associates, and longtime friends, whose observations and anecdotes reveal a chilling portrait of a leader who, in his drive to evade justice, has aligned himself with radical right-wing extremists. Netanyahu’s fixation on his entitlement to remain Prime Minister has, in this way, led to political decisions that have endangered Israel’s safety, and destroyed her standing as a democracy in the Middle East.\r\n",

The area remains marked by its tragically high death toll during the Troubles, the country’s 30-year conflict that took place between the 1960s and late 1990s. Director Alessandra Celesia unearths the emotional wounds left on the families remaining on the estate – the legacy of political violence. As protagonist Joe grapples with personal tragedy, including the murder of his teenage uncle, his story intertwines with those of his neighbours: Angie, haunted by a violent past, and Jolene, who finds solace in music. Through moving reconstructions, testimonies and archival footage, Celesia’s profound and deeply human film reveals the ways unresolved trauma endures and changes across generations.",

      "synopsis": "The New Lodge flats are located in a predominantly working class, Catholic district of Northern Ireland’s capital. The area remains marked by its tragically high death toll during the Troubles, the country’s 30-year conflict that took place between the 1960s and late 1990s. Director Alessandra Celesia unearths the emotional wounds left on the families remaining on the estate – the legacy of political violence. As protagonist Joe grapples with personal tragedy, including the murder of his teenage uncle, his story intertwines with those of his neighbours: Angie, haunted by a violent past, and Jolene, who finds solace in music. Through moving reconstructions, testimonies and archival footage, Celesia’s profound and deeply human film reveals the ways unresolved trauma endures and changes across generations.",

Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",

Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",

      "synopsis": "The New Lodge flats are located in a predominantly working class, Catholic district of Northern Ireland’s capital. The area remains marked by its tragically high death toll during the Troubles, the country’s 30-year conflict that took place between the 1960s and late 1990s. Director Alessandra Celesia unearths the emotional wounds left on the families remaining on the estate – the legacy of political violence. As protagonist Joe grapples with personal tragedy, including the murder of his teenage uncle, his story intertwines with those of his neighbours: Angie, haunted by a violent past, and Jolene, who finds solace in music. Through moving reconstructions, testimonies and archival footage, Celesia’s profound and deeply human film reveals the ways unresolved trauma endures and changes across generations.",
